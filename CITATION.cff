abstract: <p>Question answering over Linked Data / RDF-based Knowledge Graphs is a
  subdiscipline of Natural Language Processing. The specific challenge of Text 2 SPARQL
  focuses on translating natural language&nbsp;questions into SPARQL queries, a structured
  query language for interacting with RDF-based Knowledge Graphs. In this paper, we
  present a&nbsp;dataset consisting of a knowledge graph, an ontology, and a query
  catalog, which can be used as a reference for Text 2 SPARQL techniques&nbsp;such
  as LLM RAG-based approaches. The dataset was created for the&nbsp;First International
  TEXT2SPARQL Challenge, which we organized as&nbsp;part of the 4th International
  Workshop on LLM-Integrated Knowledge&nbsp;Graph Generation from Text (Text2KG) at
  the ESWC2025.</p>
